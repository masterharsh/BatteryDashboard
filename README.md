# BatteryDashboard
This is a webApp that shows the battery consumption details based on the JSON response from the server.


## Steps to run the webapp:
1- Clone the repositiory.

2- In a new terminal traverse to "server" folder and run "npm run json:server".

3- Open another new terminal, and traverse to "dasboard" folder.

  i) Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  
  ii) Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
  
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


Scope and improvements
As per the time constraint, there were few thing which could be implemented but have been ignored.
1- We could use a charting library like (Charts.js, amcharts, highcharts) to make the dashboard more intuitive.
2- Unit tests can be added for more scenarios and test cases.
