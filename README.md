# BatteryDashboard
This is a webApp that shows the battery consumption details based on the JSON response from the server.


Steps to run the webapp:
1- Clone the repositiory.
2- In a new terminal traverse to "server" folder and run "npm run json:server".
3- Open another new terminal, and traverse to "dasboard" folder. Run the command
  i) ng serve --open to run the webapp in browser at port 4200.
  ii) npm run test to run the unit tests.


Scope and improvements
As per the time constraint, there were few thing which could be implemented but have been ignored.
1- We could use a charting library like (Charts.js, amcharts, highcharts) to make the dashboard more intuitive.
2- Unit tests can be added for more scenarios and test cases.
